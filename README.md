## Introduction
This README provides an overview of the Blinking LED Light project, which is a simple IT project that demonstrates how to control and blink an LED light using a microcontroller. This project can serve as a learning resource for beginners interested in embedded systems and microcontroller programming.

## Project Overview
The Blinking LED Light project is a basic example of hardware-software integration using a microcontroller. The project involves controlling the state of an LED (Light Emitting Diode) to make it blink at a regular interval. This project can be extended and customized for more advanced applications and is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to get into embedded systems development.

## Hardware Requirements
To complete this project, you will need the following hardware components:
- An LED (any color)
- A resistor (220-330 ohms)
- A microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, etc.)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional, for easy connections)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (for Arduino boards) or suitable software for your microcontroller
- Appropriate USB drivers for your microcontroller (if required)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

## Setup and Installation
1. Assemble the hardware components by connecting the LED to the microcontroller as follows:
   - Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to one end of the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to a digital output pin on the microcontroller.
   - Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the microcontroller.

2. Install the necessary software:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE or any other compatible software for your microcontroller.
   - Connect your microcontroller board to your computer and install the required USB drivers.

3. Open the code editor and create a new project or sketch for your microcontroller.

4. Copy and paste the code provided in the `blink_led.ino` file into your code editor.

5. Upload the code to your microcontroller.

## Usage
After successfully uploading the code to your microcontroller, the LED should start blinking at the specified interval. You can customize the blinking rate by modifying the code.

## Function Demonstration
The code in the `blink_led.ino` file includes the following functions:

1. `setup()`: This function is executed once at the start of the program and is used to initialize the microcontroller. In this project, it configures the LED pin as an output.

2. `loop()`: This function is executed repeatedly and controls the LED blinking. It includes code to turn the LED on and off at a specified interval using `delay()`.

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); // Initialize LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // Turn LED on
  delay(BLINK_INTERVAL);     // Wait for a specified interval
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);  // Turn LED off
  delay(BLINK_INTERVAL);     // Wait for the same interval
}
```

You can modify the `BLINK_INTERVAL` constant to change the blinking rate, and you can also customize the code to include additional features or patterns.
